# EDA for FoodHub app
## Introduction
As the number of restaurants in New York continues to grow, busy students and professionals increasingly rely on food delivery services. FoodHub, a food aggregator app, connects customers with multiple restaurants, streamlining the ordering and delivery process.

The app facilitates direct orders from customers, assigns delivery personnel, and allows for real-time tracking and feedback. FoodHub collects data on these orders, which can provide insights into restaurant demand and enhance customer experience. This project aims to analyze this data to address key questions that will help FoodHub improve its services and business strategy.
