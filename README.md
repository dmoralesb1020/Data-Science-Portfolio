# Data-Science-Portfolio
Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio! This repository showcases a selection of projects I have worked on to highlight my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and visualization. Each project demonstrates my ability to tackle real-world problems using data-driven approaches.

## Projects Included:
### Project 1: The recovery of foreign visits to Colombia

In this project, I explored the trends in international tourism to Colombia, particularly focusing on the recovery trajectory following the disruption caused by COVID-19. 

**Skills:** Data cleaning, data analysis, visualization.

**Technology:** Microsoft Excel, MySQL Workbench, and Tableau.

### Project 2: EDA for FoodHub app

This project involved analyzing a dataset from FoodHub, a food aggregator company that connects users to multiple restaurants through a single smartphone app. I conducted an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover insights and address key questions aimed at helping the company enhance its business strategy and improve user experience.

**Skills:** univariate analysis, multivariate analysis.

**Technology:** Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).

### Project 3: Potential customers prediction with Decision Trees

In this project, I performed an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and built a predictive model to assess lead conversion, using Decision Trees and Random Forest algorithms. The dataset includes various attributes of leads, along with their interactions with ExtraaLearn, an online education platform. Through the analysis, I identified key factors influencing lead conversion and created a profile of leads most likely to convert into paying customers.


**Skills:** decision trees, random forest, univariate analysis, bivariate analysis.

**Technology:** Python (Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
