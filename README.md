# Data-Science-Portfolio
Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio! This repository showcases a selection of projects I have worked on to highlight my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and visualization. Each project demonstrates my ability to tackle real-world problems using data-driven approaches.

## Projects Included:
### Project 1: The recovery of foreign visits to Colombia

In this project, I explored the trends in international tourism to Colombia, particularly focusing on the recovery trajectory following the disruption caused by COVID-19. 

**Skills:** Data cleaning, data analysis, visualization.

**Technology:** Microsoft Excel, MySQL Workbench, and Tableau.

### Project 2: EDA for FoodHub app

This project involved analyzing a dataset from FoodHub, a food aggregator company that connects users to multiple restaurants through a single smartphone app. I conducted an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover insights and address key questions aimed at helping the company enhance its business strategy and improve user experience.

**Skills:** univariate analysis, multivariate analysis.

**Technology:** Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).

### Project 3: Potential customers prediction with Decision Trees

In this project, I performed an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and built a predictive model to assess lead conversion, using Decision Trees and Random Forest algorithms. The dataset includes various attributes of leads, along with their interactions with ExtraaLearn, an online education platform. Through the analysis, I identified key factors influencing lead conversion and created a profile of leads most likely to convert into paying customers.


**Skills:** decision trees, random forest, univariate analysis, bivariate analysis.

**Technology:** Python (Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).

### Project 4: Amazon Recommendation System

This project focuses on building a product recommendation system for Amazon using a dataset of user ratings for electronic products. The goal is to predict the ratings of products a user has not yet interacted with, allowing the system to offer personalized recommendations.

The project follows these main steps:
1.	Data Collection and Preparation: The dataset was loaded, cleaned, and preprocessed. 
2.	Exploratory Data Analysis: Summary statistics, data distributions, and missing values were analyzed. 
3.	Rank-Based Recommendation: A popularity-based system was implemented as a baseline, recommending products based on their average rating and popularity.
4.	Collaborative Filtering: This approach leveraged user-item interactions to predict ratings. User-user and item-item similarity-based collaborative filtering models were built and evaluated.
5.	Model-Based Collaborative Filtering: Matrix factorization using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) was implemented to address the limitations of similarity-based models. 
6.	Hyperparameter Tuning: Each model's hyperparameters were fine-tuned using Grid Search with cross-validation to optimize their performance. 
7.	Evaluation and Comparison: The performance of each model was compared using various metrics like RMSE, precision, recall, and F1-score. The SVD model achieved the lowest RMSE and the highest F1-score.


**Skills:** Rank-Based Recommendation, Model-Based Collaborative Filtering, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Hyperparameter Tuning.

**Technology:** Python (Surprise, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
